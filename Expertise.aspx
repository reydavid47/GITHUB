            We use this unique skill set to crack the code on shopping for health care. Our depth
            of understanding of the practice of medicine informs our selection of provider services
            to target. We apply years of experience parsing claims and remittance files to determine
            the underlying rates for all providers, both in-and out-of-network. We convert these
            findings into an actionable consumer health care shopping service.
        </p>

            ClearCost delivers meaningful savings for both plan participants and plan sponsors
            while simultaneously boosting participants' sense of control and satisfaction.
